## Goal
Define high-level implementation phases and related context for Copilot.

## Phase 1: Define Interfaces
- What: Extract shared interfaces
- Where: shared/interfaces
- Why: To allow plug-and-play implementation layers

## Phase 2: Implement Services
- What: Use interface contracts to implement Copilot-generated logic
- Where: shared/implementations

## Phase 3: Validate via Tests
- What: Integration and unit tests
- Why: To ensure Copilot-written code meets intent
